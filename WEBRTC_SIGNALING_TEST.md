# WebRTC Signaling Test

## Current Issue
- User A sends `sending-signal` but User B never receives `receiving-signal`
- This suggests the backend is not forwarding the signal properly

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Backend Logs
When User A emits `sending-signal`, you should see these logs on the backend:
```
📡 [BACKEND] ✅ Received sending-signal event
📡 [BACKEND] From: {User A ID} -> To: {User B ID}
📡 [BACKEND] Signal type: offer
🏠 [BACKEND] Room for target user {User B ID}: {ROOM_ID}
🔍 [BACKEND] Room {ROOM_ID} exists, looking for participant {User B ID}
📤 [BACKEND] ✅ Found receiver! Sending receiving-signal to {User B ID} at socket {socket_id}
📤 [BACKEND] ✅ receiving-signal event emitted successfully to {socket_id}
```

### 2. Check Frontend Logs on User B
User B should see:
```
[SOCKET] ✅ 🏠 RECEIVING-SIGNAL EVENT RECEIVED!
[RECEIVING SIGNAL] 📡 From caller: {User A ID}
[RECEIVING SIGNAL] 📡 Signal type: offer
```

### 3. If Backend Logs are Missing
- Backend is not receiving the `sending-signal` event
- Check network connectivity
- Check if socket connection is still active

### 4. If Backend Logs Exist but Frontend Doesn't Receive
- Check if User B's socket ID is correct in backend
- Check if User B is still connected to the socket

## Quick Fix Attempt
Try manually triggering a signal test by adding this to the frontend console on User B:
```javascript
console.log('Socket connected:', socket.connected);
console.log('Socket ID:', socket.id);
```
